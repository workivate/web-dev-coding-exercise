- Jest
- Enzyme
- Storybook
- NodeJS
- CircleCI/Jenkins
- Sketch/Zeplin

## Interview Process

We know the interview process can be scary. No-one enjoys interviewing, but we need to find out if you're the right fit. In the interest of transparency, the LifeWorks interview process is as follows:

### Telephone Interview
The telephone interview is a chance for us to get to know one another better.
* We’ll tell you more about LifeWorks; how the web platform works; and the way we work.
* We’ll ask you some questions about your previous experience, why you’re looking for a new challenge and what you are looking for next in your career.
* We’ll also ask a few React and Redux questions to ensure we are not wasting your time.

### Coding Exercise
This coding exercise right here. The instructions will be given to you separately.

### Face to Face Interview
Preparation:  Please bring either your laptop or a URL to a code base (e.g. on Github) with a React/Redux application you’ve previously worked on that we can look at during the interview.
The face to face interview will be with two members of the web development team and consist of the following parts:
* We’ll run through your coding exercise, asking about your process and how you approached particular problems.
* We’ll ask you to choose an area of the project you have selected that you are particularly proud of, so we can talk about your approach and how you overcame any challenges building that application.
* We’ll ask some React/Redux questions.
* We’ll present you with some real world React/Redux problems as diagrams and ask you to walk through how you would solve the problem.
* We’ll answer any questions you have about LifeWorks and how we work.

## The Joel Test

Here is how we fair on the [Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/):

1. **Do you use source control?** Yes, we use Git & Github.
2. **Can you make a build in one step?** Running `npm run build` makes a build.
3. **Do you make daily builds?** Every new PR automatically triggers a Jest, ESLint and Flowtype check before it can be merged, and code needs to be reviewed by at least one of your peers. We make and merge PRs daily, which each time triggers a build. These are automatically deployed to a test environment and used by our QA team.
4. **Do you have a bug database?** We use JIRA for tracking bugs and writing stories.
5. **Do you fix bugs before writing new code?** Not always. We aim to fix as many bugs as possible before moving on to a new project, but with a large platform like ours bugs do occur. We have increased our test coverage to ensure the number of bugs found is dramatically reduced, and continue to write tests for all new code.
6. **Do you have a schedule?** Work is carried out in 2 week sprints against a larger roadmap.
7. **Do you have a spec?** Requirements and stories are written before features are developed. UX and UI is designed using Sketch. An API contract is written, agreed and mocked to ensure the front end developers can commence work.
8. **Do programmers have quiet working conditions?** Our office is open-plan, but there are areas around the office where you can sit quietly, or there is the option to work from home from time to time.
9. **Do you use the best tools money can buy?** Our team work on the latest Macbook Pros using their choice of IDE (normally WebStorm or VSCode). We regularly update our libraries (React, Webpack etc.) to the latest versions so we can use the latest features. We also have a [meeting owl](https://www.owllabs.com/) for remote workers.
10. **Do you have testers?** Yes, we have dedicated testers. We run both manual and automated tests before each release.
11. **Do new candidates write code during their interview?** See: this test.
12. **Do you do hallway usability testing?** We have a dedicated UX and UI team that conduct a variety of UX testing, which is sometimes hallway testing.
